# Variant Images

Control which images display for each variant.

## Variant Image Set

Show only relevant images when a variant is selected.

### Setup

1. Assign images to variants in Shopify admin
2. Theme automatically filters gallery

### How It Works

When a customer selects "Blue":
- Gallery shows only blue product images
- Other color images are hidden

## Configuration

In theme editor → Product page:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Variant image switching | Enable/disable |
| Animation | Fade, Slide, None |
| Update URL | Add variant to URL |

## Best Practices

::: tip Image Organization
- Use consistent naming: `product-blue-1.jpg`
- Assign all relevant images to variants
- Include lifestyle shots per variant
:::

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Images not switching | Assign images to variants |
| Wrong images showing | Check image assignments |
| No change on select | Enable variant switching |

## Alternative: Color Swatch Images

For products where variant images aren't needed:
1. Use color swatches for selection
2. Show all images in gallery
3. Enable hover image on cards
