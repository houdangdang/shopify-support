## Configuring payment method icons

All our themes shows, by default, the supported payment methods icons in the footer. In case you disabled the feature by mistake, to re-enable this setting, open the theme editor and click on the **"Footer"** section:

And turn on the **"Show payment methods"** setting:

### FAQ

#### How the icons are selected?

The supported payment methods are not directly controlled by the theme. Rather, they are returned by Shopify to the theme based on your enabled payment providers. If a specific payment icon does not appear, double check your payment providers to ensure the payment method is correctly enabled.

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Payment method icons are automatically provided by Shopify based on your enabled payment providers in Shopify admin. The theme only displays what Shopify provides.

#### How to add custom payment icon such as Klarna or AfterPay?

Because the theme does not control the enabled payment methods, if some icons are not automatically displayed, you will need to reach the support of the respective payment method (such as Klarna or AfterPay) to ask them to edit the code to add their icons. Our support team does not provide any support to do that.

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> For custom payment method icons (like Klarna, AfterPay, etc.), you need to contact the payment provider's support directly. They need to update their integration with Shopify to include their icons in the footer.

### Troubleshooting Payment Icons

**Icons not showing:**
- Verify the payment method is enabled in Shopify admin
- Check that "Show payment methods" is enabled in Footer section
- Confirm you're using a compatible payment provider

**Missing specific icons:**
- Contact the payment provider's support
- Some providers require additional integration steps
- Third-party payment apps may have their own icon systems

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Shopify automatically updates payment method icons when you enable or disable payment providers. No manual theme edits are needed for standard Shopify Payments methods.
