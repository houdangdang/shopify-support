## Configuring search

Our themes offer powerful search functionalities powered by Shopify's search functionality. There are two kinds of search:

- **Predictive search:** this appears in the header and shows suggested results as you type. It helps your customers refine their search without being redirected to a search results page and quickly explore your store by seeing top results for suggested search terms, products, collections, and more.

- **Search page:** if customers click a view more button in the predictive search, they are redirected to a dedicated search page. Search pages work like collections, and your customers can refine the search by using filtering.

  <strong>Note:</strong> Predictive search is currently only supported in some languages. You can find a <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search" target="_blank">list of supported languages in Shopify documentation</a>. Specifically, most Asian languages, such as Japanese or Korean, do not currently support predictive search. If you wish to have support for your language, we recommend you reach Shopify support.

### Using Search & Discovery app

The search experience is not configured on the theme, but in the Search & Discovery app (a free app developed by Shopify). This app is installed by default on new stores, but if you do not have it, you can [download it here](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery).

Among others, Search & Discovery app allows you to:

- Configure filters on search and collections pages.
- Configure how sold-out products appear in your search results.
- Add synonyms to take into account typography and spelling mistakes.
- Add boosts so that some products appear higher in your search.
