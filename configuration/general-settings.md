## Changing fonts and custom fonts

Our themes integrate with Shopify font library, an extensive library of hundreds of fonts. Our themes allow you to choose a font for heading and body text.

To change the font, open the theme editor, click on the **"Theme settings"** icon, and click on the **Typography** category. Then, you can choose the desired font.

### FAQ

#### Custom fonts

Themes only integrate with the Shopify font picker. It is not possible to integrate custom fonts without coding. If you wish to add a custom font that is unavailable in Shopify's font picker, you [must hire a developer](https://support.GirlElements.com/article/698-hiring-a-shopify-expert-for-customization).

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Our themes do not support custom fonts outside of Shopify's font library. Adding custom fonts requires code customization by a developer.
</div>

#### Performance concerns

Changing the font can help you to adapt your store to your brand. However, fonts can be slow to load and impact your store's performance. We therefore recommend you to limit the number of different fonts you are using and try to favor system fonts whenever possible.

System fonts are fonts already available on every computer. In Shopify font picker, system fonts appear at the top:

For a good balance, we recommend using a system font for the body text (so that the main content appears as fast as possible without having to load a font) and a different font for headings.

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> For optimal performance, use a system font for body text and a custom font only for headings. This ensures fast loading while maintaining brand identity.

### Font Best Practices

| Element | Recommendation | Reason |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| **Body text** | System font | Faster loading, better readability |
| **Headings** | Custom font | Brand identity, visual appeal |
| **Number of fonts** | Maximum 2-3 | Reduces loading time |
| **Font weights** | Use standard weights (400, 600, 700) | Better browser compatibility |

## Changing colors

All our themes allow you to adapt the colors to your branding. To do that, open the theme editor, and click on the **"General settings"** icon, and click on the **"Colors":**

Colors are meant to adjust a whole section or store appearance. Unless there is a specific setting for it, you cannot change a single color of a particular element.

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> If you have very specific needs and want to change the color of a single element without impacting the others, you must <a href="https://support.GirlElements.com/article/698-hiring-a-shopify-expert-for-customization">hire a developer</a>.
</div>

### Color Categories

Most themes organize colors into logical categories:

| Category | Description | Elements Affected |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Text** | Primary and secondary text colors | Body text, headings, links |
| **Backgrounds** | Page and section backgrounds | Page background, section backgrounds |
| **Buttons** | Primary and secondary button colors | Add to cart buttons, CTAs |
| **Forms** | Input fields and borders | Text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes |
| **Accent** | Highlight and special elements | Sale badges, notifications |

### Color Best Practices

- **Brand consistency:** Choose colors that match your brand guidelines
- **Contrast ratio:** Ensure sufficient contrast for readability (WCAG 4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Color psychology:** Consider how colors affect customer perception
- **Limited palette:** Stick to 2-3 primary colors plus neutrals

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Color changes in the theme editor apply globally. To change colors for specific elements only, you need custom code or section-specific settings if available.
</div>

## Adding a favicon

A favicon is a small image that is typically displayed in tab of your browser (some browsers like Safari tend to hide them, though).

All of our themes allow you to upload a favicon image without modifying the code.

### Steps to Add a Favicon

1. Open the theme editor, and select the **"General settings"** tab at the top.
2. At the bottom, click on the section called **"Favicon"**.
3. Upload the image as indicated in the settings, and save.

### Favicon Guidelines

| Requirement | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Format** | PNG, ICO, or JPG |
| **Size** | 32x32px or 64x64px (will be scaled) |
| **File size** | Under 100KB |
| **Design** | Simple, recognizable at small size |
| **Background** | Transparent or matching your brand |

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Your favicon should be a simplified version of your logo. Complex designs with small text won't be visible at favicon size.
</div>

### Favicon Not Showing?

If your favicon doesn't appear immediately:
- Clear your browser cache
- Try viewing in an incognito/private window
- Check that the image uploaded successfully
- Verify the file format is supported

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Some browsers (like Safari) may not always display favicons consistently. This is a browser behavior, not a theme issue.
