## Changing fonts and custom fonts

Our themes integrate with Shopify font library, an extensive library of hundreds of fonts. Our themes allow you to choose a font for heading and body text.

To change the font, open the theme editor, click on the **"Theme settings"** icon, and click on the **Typography** category. Then, you can choose the desired font.

### FAQ

#### Custom fonts

Themes only integrate with the Shopify font picker. It is not possible to integrate custom fonts without coding. If you wish to add a custom font that is unavailable in Shopify's font picker, you [must hire a developer](/theme-basics/hiring-shopify-expert).

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Our themes do not support custom fonts outside of Shopify's font library. Adding custom fonts requires code customization by a developer.

#### Performance concerns

Changing the font can help you to adapt your store to your brand. However, fonts can be slow to load and impact your store's performance. We therefore recommend you to limit the number of different fonts you are using and try to favor system fonts whenever possible.

System fonts are fonts already available on every computer. In Shopify font picker, system fonts appear at the top:

<img src="/public/assets/images/configuring/general-settings/select-fonts.png" alt="Select Fonts" style="max-height: 300px; width: auto; display: block; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;">

For a good balance, we recommend using a system font for the body text (so that the main content appears as fast as possible without having to load a font) and a different font for headings.

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> For optimal performance, use a system font for body text and a custom font only for headings. This ensures fast loading while maintaining brand identity.

## Changing colors

All our themes allow you to adapt the colors to your branding. To do that, open the theme editor, and click on the **"General settings"** icon, and click on the **"Colors"**:

Colors are meant to adjust a whole section or store appearance. Unless there is a specific setting for it, you cannot change a single color of a particular element.

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> If you have very specific needs and want to change the color of a single element without impacting the others, you must <a href="https://support.maestrooo.com/article/698-hiring-a-shopify-expert-for-customization">hire a developer</a>.

## Adding a favicon

A favicon is a small image that is typically displayed in tab of your browser (some browsers like Safari tend to hide them, though).

All of our themes allow you to upload a favicon image without modifying the code.

### Steps to Add a Favicon

1. Open the theme editor, and select the **"Theme settings"** tab at the top.
2. At the bottom, click on the section called **"Favicon"**.
3. Upload the image as indicated in the settings, and save.

<img src="/public/assets/images/configuring/general-settings/upload-favicon.png" alt="Upload Favicon" style="max-height: 500px; width: auto; display: block; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;">

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Some browsers (like Safari) may not always display favicons consistently. This is a browser behavior, not a theme issue.
