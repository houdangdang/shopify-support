## Gathering extra information with cart attributes

Cart attributes are a Shopify feature that allows you to gather extra information about an order, such as a delivery day, a gift message, or similar information.

Our theme does not allow adding arbitrary cart attributes, as each store has its own requirements and specific information to gather. Consequently, to gather extra cart information, you must either install an app (you can reach Shopify support for some recommendations) or [hire a developer](/theme-basics/hiring-shopify-expert). Our support team does not offer coding support to do that.

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Cart attributes are different from product options or checkout fields. They are custom fields that appear on the cart page to collect additional information before checkout.
</div>

### Common Use Cases for Cart Attributes

Cart attributes can be used to collect various types of information:

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Delivery preferences** | Preferred delivery day or time |
| **Gift messages** | Personalized message for gift orders |
| **Special instructions** | Handling or packaging requests |
| **Order notes** | Additional information about the order |
| **Customization details** | Extra details for custom products |

### Implementation Options

#### Option 1: Shopify Apps

Several Shopify apps can add cart attribute functionality without coding:

- **Cart customization apps** - Add custom fields to your cart
- **Checkout customization apps** - Extend checkout with additional fields
- **Order management apps** - Collect and manage extra order information

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Contact Shopify support for app recommendations that best fit your specific use case and budget.
</div>

#### Option 2: Custom Development

For more complex requirements or complete control over the cart attributes:

- Hire a Shopify Expert or developer
- Custom code the cart attribute fields
- Integrate with your specific business workflow

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Our theme support team does not provide coding assistance for cart attributes. If you need custom cart attributes, you must work with a developer or use a third-party app.
</div>

### Alternative: Cart Notes

If you only need simple text input from customers, consider using the built-in **Cart notes** feature:

1. Open theme editor
2. Navigate to **Cart** settings
3. Enable **Cart note**
4. Customize the placeholder text

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Cart notes are a simple, built-in alternative to cart attributes. They allow customers to add a single text note to their order. However, they don't support structured data like dropdowns, dates, or checkboxes.
</div>
