# Sections

Common questions for popular sections

## Slideshow

The Slideshow (also known as carousel or banner) is a popular section that allows you to show one or multiple full-page images (and/or video; it is only available on our themes Prestige and Impact). A slideshow is typically found as the first section on the home page to create an impactful impression on your customers.

### Adding a slideshow

All our themes are pre-configured with a slideshow section on the home page. If you have deleted it or would like to add a new one, open the theme editor, click on **"Add section"** and select **"Slideshow"**.

### FAQ

#### How many slides should I have?

While it might be tempting to add a lot of slides, we recommend you limit yourself to two or three. By creating too many slides, many customers will probably never see the fourth slide and after.

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep your slideshow concise with 2-3 slides maximum for better user engagement.
</div>

#### How to make a specific slide clickable?

Slides can show a button to create a link to another page. It might be desirable, though, to make the whole banner clickable. To do that, configure the slide so that the **"Button 1 link"** (or **"Button link"** on some theme) is configured with a link and that the **"Button text"** is left empty. The slide will become fully clickable.

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> To make an entire slide clickable, add a link to "Button 1 link" but leave "Button text" empty.
</div>

#### Does it impact performance?

A slideshow does not negatively impact performance, as the theme uses efficient code. However, because the slideshow is usually the first section on the page, the images you upload must be optimized to load fast. We highly recommend you use an image in JPG format (avoid PNG format as PNG images tend to be way bigger), and optimize your images using a service like [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/). If you decide to use a video for a slide, use a MP4 video and try to use a short video of a few seconds (avoid very long videos).

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Always optimize your slideshow images for web performance:
  <ul>
    <li>Use JPG format instead of PNG</li>
    <li>Compress images using tools like <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/" target="_blank">TinyJPG</a></li>
    <li>Keep videos short (a few seconds) and in MP4 format</li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Images are cut

By default, the slideshow is configured not to cut (crop) images. However, the slideshow also offers an **"Image size"** setting that allows you to force a fixed size for the slideshow (small, medium, large, etc.). When selecting one of those fixed sizes, the theme must resize your images so that they can fit into the allocated space. This resizing causes your images to be cut. If you want to ensure that slideshow images are never cropped, you must select the **"Original image size"** setting.

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> To prevent image cropping, select "Original image size" in the slideshow settings instead of fixed sizes like small, medium, or large.
</div>

## Blog posts

In Shopify, each **"Blog posts"** section can only show content from one blog at a time. A blog in Shopify is a group of posts. GirlElements themes are set up to display content from just one blog per section.

If you'd like to show posts from more than one blog, you can add extra **"Blog posts"** sections and link each one to a different blog. This way, you can feature multiple blogs on your page, with each blog in its own section.

Alternatively, you can add more blog posts to your blog so they can be displayed within a single section. Unless you have a very specific use case, we recommend keeping all the blog posts inside a single blog and using tags to categorize articles inside a given blog.

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">

### FAQ

#### What is the difference between a blog and a blog post?

A blog is a list of blog posts, while a blog post represents a single article. It is similar to collections and products.

**Example:**
- **Blog:** "News" (the container)
- **Blog posts:** Individual articles like "Summer Collection Launch", "Behind the Scenes", etc.

#### When I add a blog posts section, not all articles show up

A blog post section can only show articles coming from the same blog. If you have created multiple blogs, you must create one section for each blog, or you should merge all your blog posts into a single blog.

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Each "Blog posts" section displays content from only one blog. If you have multiple blogs, you need to add separate sections for each blog.
</div>

#### When should I create more than one blog?

You usually only want to create one blog and have all your articles inside the same blog. This makes maintenance easier, and your customers can read all your blog posts more easily. To allow blog post filtering, you can add tags to your blog posts (for instance, a "News" blog might contain articles with the tags "Travel," "Lifestyle," "Food,"...).

It might be desirable to have different blogs when you want to share completely different stories to various audiences. For instance, if you have both B2B and B2C customers, you might want to create a B2C-oriented blog, and a B2B-oriented blog.

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Best practices for blog organization:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Single blog:</strong> Keep all posts in one blog and use tags for categorization (recommended for most stores)</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple blogs:</strong> Only create separate blogs when targeting completely different audiences (e.g., B2B vs B2C)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

**Use cases for multiple blogs:**
- Separate B2B and B2C content
- Different language blogs (if not using Shopify Markets)
- Completely different content types (e.g., company news vs. product tutorials)

**Recommended approach:**
Use a single blog with tags for easier maintenance and better user experience. Tags allow customers to filter content while keeping everything in one place.
