# Contextualizing content per market

## Changing content per market

To edit a section per market, open the Theme Editor, and select the market you want to change in the market picker at the top of the editor (Shopify will show all the markets you have created):

Once you have selected a market, you can edit the content of one or multiple sections. If a block or a section has been changed, a small green icon will be visible next to the element that has been contextualized:

## FAQ

### I changed the content, but it does not reflect in my live store

One important thing to understand about contextualizing a market is that once you create a contextualization for a given market, the page will evolve independently from the default market. Simply put any changes to the default market won't be reflected in a contextualized market unless you apply the change to the contextualized market.

This is a frequent source of confusion for merchants who do not understand why the changes made in the theme editor are not visible in the live store. This is because the theme editor always shows the default market, while the live store will show the contextualization of the market you live in.

Consequently, if your changes are not visible on the live store, check that you have also applied the change to all the markets.

### What is the difference between translation and contextualization

To change content for a given market, you can either do it in the theme editor through contextualization, or in a translation app such as the [Translate & Adapt app](https://apps.shopify.com/translate-and-adapt). There are, however, some fundamental differences between the two.

- Translation: translating the section content is the recommended approach if you want to simply translate the content into multiple languages. It won't create contextualized templates and will avoid all the complexities involved in contextualization, such as content not showing.
- Contextualization: contextualization is useful when you want to create a different experience based on the market, such as adding/removing sections based on the country, or do larger scale changes that involve more than just translating. We recommend to limit the usage of contextualization, as it makes it harder to manage the store.

### Can I delete a contextualization?

If you created a contextualization and would like to revert to the original content, [please refer to the official Shopify documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/customizing-themes/store-contextualization).
