# Access the collaborator code

A collaborator code is a 4-digit code that allows our support team to send an invite to access your store so that we can perform easier debugging or fix theme bugs.

Starting from 2024, this 4-digit code will become mandatory for every new store. We recommend you fill out the collaborator code to improve problem resolution time when reaching our support.

To find your collaborator code, open your Shopify admin, click on "Settings," then "Users and permissions", and copy the collaborator code found in the "Collaborators" box.
