# Changing default theme content

Our themes are pre-translated into more than 20 languages. However, you may want to adjust some pre-defined wordings to match your brand's tone better.

To do that, in the theme list, for the theme you wish to edit, click on the three dots **"More actions"** button, and select **"Edit default theme content":**

You will see each wording pre-defined by the theme. To edit an existing sentence/wording, type the first few letters in the **"Filters"** box and change the text to your desired one:

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The default theme content only changes your store's primary language. If your store is translated into multiple languages and you wish to change the wording of the non-primary language, you need to use a translation app, such as the free <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/translate-and-adapt" target="_blank">Translate & Adapt app</a>. For more information on how to translate your store, please get in touch with the translation app developers you are using.

### Common Text Elements to Customize

| Element | Default Text | Use Case |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Add to cart button** | "Add to cart" | Change to "Add to bag", "Buy now", etc. |
| **Sold out badge** | "Sold out" | Change to "Out of stock", "Unavailable", etc. |
| **Sale badge** | "Sale" | Change to "Discount", "% Off", etc. |
| **Search placeholder** | "Search..." | Change to "Find products...", etc. |
| **Cart empty message** | "Your cart is empty" | Customize brand voice |

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Use the filter box to quickly find specific text. Just type 2-3 letters from the text you want to change.

### Best Practices

- **Keep it concise:** Button text and labels should be short and clear
- **Be consistent:** Use the same terminology throughout your store
- **Match your brand voice:** Formal vs casual depending on your audience
- **Test on mobile:** Ensure longer text doesn't break mobile layouts

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Changes to default theme content apply to your entire store. Make sure you're happy with the wording before saving, as it affects all pages.
