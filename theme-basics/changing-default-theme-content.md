# Changing default theme content

Our themes are pre-translated into more than 20 languages. However, you may want to adjust some pre-defined wordings to match your brand's tone better.

To do that, in the theme list, for the theme you wish to edit, click on the three dots **"More actions" button, and select "Edit default theme content"**:

<img src="/assets/images/theme-basics/changing-default-theme-content-1.gif" alt="image" style="max-height: 800px; width: auto; display: block; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px;">

You will see each wording pre-defined by the theme. To edit an existing sentence/wording, type the first few letters in the "Filters" box and change the text to your desired one:

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  The default theme content only changes your store's primary language. If your store is translated into multiple languages and you wish to change the wording of the non-primary language, you need to use a translation app, such as the free [*Translate &amp; Adapt app*](https://apps.shopify.com/translate-and-adapt)*. *For more information on how to translate your store, please get in touch with the translation app developers you are using.
