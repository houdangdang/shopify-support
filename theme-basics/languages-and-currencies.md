# Multi-languages, currencies and internationalization

If you sell internationally, your store must be available in multiple languages and currencies. Our themes provide full support for selling in a number of languages and currencies, although setting these up needs to be done in the Shopify admin area.

### How to add multiple currencies and translations to your theme

You can set up currencies and languages in the Shopify admin rather than within the theme itself. The theme displays the information based on what Shopify provides the theme. Our themes include language files for specific built-in theme text, such as 'Add to cart' text, 'Search' text etc. 

Themes are not able to automatically translate any text you enter in the Theme Editor or the Shopify admin area (e.g. product descriptions, page content, blog articles, etc). To translate these, refer to the [Shopify translation app](https://apps.shopify.com/translate-and-adapt) or an alternative [third-party translation app](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=translate&st_source=autocomplete).

  When using 3rd a party app for translations, the app developers have the responsibility to ensure compatibility with all themes on the Shopify theme store. If you encounter any issues while using their app, please reach out to the respective developer for assistance.

#### How to add languages

Languages are not added via the theme but via the Shopify languages page of the admin area. For more information on adding languages refer to the [Shopify languages](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/languages) support docs which will guide you through the process.

#### How to add currencies

Currencies are not added via the theme but via the Shopify markets page of the admin area. For more information on adding currencies refer to the [Shopify markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/) support docs which will guide you through the process.

#### How to enable the language/currency selector

Each of our themes are equipped with convenient language and currency selectors, seamlessly integrated into either the Header section or the Footer section, depending on which theme you use.

To find and activate the language/currency selectors, simply open these sections inside the Theme Editor. Once you have configured the languages/currencies (see previous sections for more), the relevant currency/language options should show within the selectors.

On mobile devices, these selectors can be found within the burger menu to ensure optimal use of screen space.

<div style="background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; padding: 12px; margin: 16px 0; color: #1a1a1a;">
  Our themes do not support moving the currency and/or language selectors to the header on mobile, for size reasons. If you want to do that, you must <a href="/shopify-support/theme-basics/hiring-shopify-expert">hire a developer</a>. We also recommend you to <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/automatic-redirection#language-redirection">enable the automatic language redirection</a>. This ensures that customers view your website in their own language automatically, hence removing the need to show a selector in the header.
