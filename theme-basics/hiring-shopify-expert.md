# Hiring a Shopify Expert for customization

While our themes offer many sections and settings, there might be cases where you would like to add unique features designed for your brand.

To do that, the best way is to reach a Shopify Expert, a curated list of highly experienced Shopify developers. We have partnered with several companies that you can reach:

 - [Shopify Experts](https://experts.shopify.com/): a list of skilled Shopify developers curated by Shopify, ideal for small to large-scale changes.

  We are not affiliated with any of those companies. We cannot be held responsible for any bad experience you might have. As a rule of thumb, we do not recommend Experts who are priced too cheap, and we also highly discourage the usage of platforms external to Shopify, such as Fiverr.
