# B2B features (quantity rules, volume pricing...)

Shopify Plus merchants can have access to exclusive B2B features, such as creating catalogs for companies, quantity rules, and volume pricing. You can learn more about Shopify B2B features on [Shopify documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b).

Before using B2B features, you must make sure that you are on the Shopify Plus plan, and that you have the new customer accounts enabled. If you are not on the Plus plan, we recommend you to reach Shopify support for app recommendations.

Some B2B features like per-company pricing and catalog support are supported on all the versions of our themes. However, the following features are only available from Prestige 10.3.0, Impact 6.3.0, Focal 12.3.0 and Verve 6.2.0.

- Quantity rules: quantity rules allow you to set a minimum, maximum, and increment quantity for variants. When defined, the theme quantity selector will adjust to only allow quantities in the defined range.
- Quantity breaks (also known as volume pricing): new versions of our themes support adding a volume pricing table.
