# Browser support

Our themes fully support the latest two major versions of each browser. We are making an exception for Safari because Safari releases are not automatic and are tied to the operating system version. For Safari, we guarantee support from iOS14 up to the latest version. Please note that iOS14 is not guaranteed to display the same as more recent versions (however, the full purchasing flow is guaranteed to work).

Our support does not cover any issue caused by using an unsupported browser version. If you want to add compatibility for an older browser, we recommend you check your analytics to see if it is worthwhile and hire a Shopify Expert.

## JavaScript
Our themes are all developed to work without JavaScript. However, please remember that some features, such as modal or menu, will only work with JavaScript. When JavaScript is disabled, we only provide a guarantee for the main purchase flow (home page => product => checkout).
