# Support policy

Our support team is here to assist you from Monday to Friday. Before contacting us, please review our support policy.

## What we offer:
- Pre-sale questions
- Bug fixes that are due to the theme
- Assistance to setup sections or settings

## What we do not offer:
- Custom development (such as Custom CSS, creating new sections, adding new settings...)
- App integrations and app debugging
- Checkout customization (checkout being isolated from the theme, any checkout question must be sent to Shopify support directly)
- Assistance on features unrelated to the theme (such as Shopify admin)
